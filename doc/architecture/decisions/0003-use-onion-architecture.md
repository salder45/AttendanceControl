# 3. Use Onion Architecture

Date: 2025-04-23

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As I am trying to make this project a proper one, I need to define an architecture, previously I take a course but there are a lot of options.

## Decision

Because a found a post of someone using the onion architecture and as I am not sure what architecture to use I am going with this one. [Onion Architecture](https://josealopez.dev/blog/authentication-with-spring-security-and-jwt) 

## Consequences

Using this architecture I don't know anything about is going to force me to learn it, There will be a lot of issues but at least it's a framework to start with.
